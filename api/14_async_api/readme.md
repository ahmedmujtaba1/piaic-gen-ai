## AsyncAPI: Describing the World of Asynchronous APIs

[AsyncAPI V3 with Fran MÃ©ndez](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/fran-mendez-asyncapi-v3/)

AsyncAPI is an open-source initiative working to improve the current state of **Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs)**. It aims to make working with EDAs as streamlined and straightforward as working with REST APIs. This involves several key aspects:

**1. Specification:**

- AsyncAPI provides a **standardized format** for describing asynchronous APIs, similar to what OpenAPI (Swagger) does for REST APIs. This specification defines events, channels, message formats, and other elements involved in event-driven communication.

**2. Tooling Ecosystem:**

- AsyncAPI fosters a growing ecosystem of **open-source tools** built around the specification. These tools include documentation generators, code generators, API gateways, and more. This promotes consistent practices and simplifies various aspects of EDA development and management.

**3. Documenting APIs:**

- AsyncAPI helps you document your asynchronous APIs clearly and effectively. Tools like AsyncAPI Generator can create HTML or Markdown documentation based on your AsyncAPI spec, making it easy for developers to understand how your events work.

**4. Code Generation:**

- AsyncAPI facilitates code generation for various programming languages. This means you can automatically generate client libraries, server stubs, and other code artifacts based on your AsyncAPI spec, saving you time and effort.

**5. Open Governance:**

- AsyncAPI is an open-source project hosted by the Linux Foundation. This ensures transparency and community involvement in shaping the future of the specification and its supporting tools.

**Benefits of using AsyncAPI:**

* **Improved communication and understanding:** Clear documentation and standardized format lead to better collaboration and knowledge sharing within teams working on event-driven systems.
* **Faster development and deployment:** Code generation and streamlined documentation creation improve development efficiency, allowing you to build and deploy asynchronous APIs quicker.
* **Simplified integration and testing:** Standardized events and messages enable easier integration between different services and facilitate automated testing of event-driven interactions.
* **Enhanced scalability and resilience:** Event-driven architectures built with AsyncAPI can be more scalable and resilient due to their decoupled nature and asynchronous communication style.

[Interact with AsyncAPI from the comfort of your CLI](https://www.asyncapi.com/tools/cli) **Here's an AsyncAPI example document implementing a request-response pattern, adhering to specification 3.0.0:**

```yaml
asyncapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Product Order API
  version: 1.0.0

channels:
  user/signup:
    publish:
      message:
        $ref: "#/components/messages/SignupRequest"
    subscribe:
      message:
        $ref: "#/components/messages/SignupResponse"

components:
  messages:
    SignupRequest:
      payload:
        type: object
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
          email:
            type: string
          password:
            type: string
    SignupResponse:
      payload:
        type: object
        properties:
          success:
            type: boolean
          message:
            type: string
```

**Key Points:**

- **asyncapi**: Version declaration (`3.0.0`).
- **info**: Basic API information (title, version).
- **channels**: Definition of the request-response channel (`user/signup`).
    - **publish**: Details for messages sent to the channel (SignupRequest).
    - **subscribe**: Details for messages received from the channel (SignupResponse).
- **components**: Reusable message definitions.
    - **SignupRequest**: Schema for the request payload (name, email, password).
    - **SignupResponse**: Schema for the response payload (success, message).

**Explanation:**

1. **Client sends a SignupRequest message** to the `user/signup` channel.
2. **Server receives the request**, processes it, and **sends a SignupResponse message** back to the client on the same channel.

**Example Request:**

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "password": "secretpassword"
}
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User created successfully"
}
```

**Remember:** This example demonstrates the basic structure of a request-response pattern in AsyncAPI 3.0.0. Adapt it to your specific API requirements by defining additional channels, messages, and payload structures as needed.

**While FastAPI doesn't natively support AsyncAPI, you can implement a request-response pattern using a combination of FastAPI and a messaging library like Redis:**

**1. Install Dependencies:**

```bash
pip install fastapi redis
```

**2. Create FastAPI Application:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import redis

app = FastAPI()
redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)  # Replace with your Redis connection details
```

**3. Define Endpoint for Receiving Requests:**

```python
@app.post('/user/signup')
async def handle_signup(request: SignupRequest):
    request_data = request.dict()
    # Process request data (e.g., store user in database)

    response_data = {"success": True, "message": "User created successfully"}
    redis_client.publish("user/signup", response_data)  # Publish response to Redis channel

    return response_data  # Return response to client for immediate feedback
```

**4. Create Background Task to Process Responses:**

```python
async def process_responses():
    while True:
        response_data = await redis_client.subscribe("user/signup")
        # Handle the response data (e.g., send to client via WebSockets or other means)

asyncio.create_task(process_responses())  # Start the background task
```

**Key Points:**

- **Redis as a Broker:** Redis acts as a message broker for request-response communication.
- **FastAPI Endpoint:** Handles incoming requests and publishes responses to Redis.
- **Background Task:** Continuously listens for responses on the Redis channel.
- **Message Serialization/Deserialization:** Manage message formats (e.g., JSON) for Redis interactions.

**Considerations:**

- **Message Queue Frameworks:** For more robust messaging patterns, consider frameworks like RabbitMQ or Kafka.
- **WebSockets:** Explore WebSockets for true bidirectional communication if required.
- **Custom Middleware:** Implement custom FastAPI middleware to streamline AsyncAPI integration.

**Remember:** Adapt this example to your specific API requirements, including message structures, processing logic, and communication channels.


**Here's a guide to implementing the request-response pattern using Kafka and FastAPI, along with an updated AsyncAPI document:**

**AsyncAPI Document (Updated):**

```yaml
asyncapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Product Order API
  version: 1.0.0

channels:
  user/signup:
    publish:
      message:
        $ref: "#/components/messages/SignupRequest"
    subscribe:
      message:
        $ref: "#/components/messages/SignupResponse"

components:
  messages:
    SignupRequest:
      payload:
        type: object
        properties:
          name:
            type: string
          email:
            type: string
          password:
            type: string
    SignupResponse:
      payload:
        type: object
        properties:
          success:
            type: boolean
          message:
            type: string
  bindings:
    kafka:
      type: kafka
      description: Kafka binding for request-response communication
      bindingVersion: '0.1.0'

servers:
  kafka:
    url: kafka://localhost:9092
    protocol: kafka
    description: Kafka broker
```

**Key Changes:**

- **bindings**: Added a Kafka binding definition.
- **servers**: Specified a Kafka server URL.

**FastAPI Implementation:**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from aiokafka import AIOKafkaProducer, AIOKafkaConsumer

app = FastAPI()

# Kafka producer and consumer configuration
producer = AIOKafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
consumer = AIOKafkaConsumer('user/signup', bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')

@app.post('/user/signup')
async def handle_signup(request: SignupRequest):
    request_data = request.dict()
    await producer.send_and_wait('user/signup', request_data)  # Send request to Kafka

    response = await consumer.getone()  # Wait for response from Kafka
    response_data = response.value
    return response_data
```

**Key Points:**

- **aiokafka:** Library for asynchronous Kafka interactions.
- **Producer and Consumer:** Separate instances for request sending and response receiving.
- **send_and_wait:** Blocks until the request is acknowledged by Kafka.
- **getone:** Waits for a single response message.

**Remember:**

- Adapt the Kafka configuration to your specific setup.
- Ensure proper error handling and message serialization/deserialization.
- Consider advanced Kafka features like consumer groups for scalability.
- Explore tools like AsyncAPI Studio for visualizing and managing AsyncAPI definitions.


 **Here's how to generate clients in TypeScript and Python using the AsyncAPI document:**

**1. Choose a Code Generation Tool:**

- **AsyncAPI Generator:** Comprehensive tool supporting TypeScript, Python, and various other languages.
- **NSwag:** Popular option for .NET and TypeScript code generation.
- **Python-specific tools:** Explore libraries like `asyncapi-python` or `aiokafka-client` for tailored Python clients.

**2. Install the Tool:**

- Use npm or yarn to install AsyncAPI Generator:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @asyncapi/generator
  ```
- Use pip to install Python-specific tools as needed.

**3. Run the Code Generation Command:**

**TypeScript:**
  ```bash
  asyncapi-generator generate -i asyncapi.yaml -g typescript-axios -o ./typescript-client
  ```

**Python:**
  ```bash
  asyncapi-generator generate -i asyncapi.yaml -g python-aiokafka -o ./python-client
  ```
  - Adjust generators (`typescript-axios`, `python-aiokafka`) based on your preferences and tool support.

**4. Customize and Integrate:**

- Review generated code for compatibility with your project setup and libraries.
- Incorporate generated clients into your TypeScript and Python applications to interact with the Kafka-based request-response API.

**Key Considerations:**

- **Generator Features:** Explore tool-specific features like model validation, parameter customization, and code formatting options.
- **Kafka Integration:** Ensure the generated clients seamlessly interact with your Kafka broker and handle Kafka-specific concepts correctly.
- **Dependency Management:** Verify compatibility between generated code and your project's dependencies.

**Remember:**

- Adapt commands and generators to your chosen tools and language preferences.
- Thoroughly test generated clients to ensure they meet your application's requirements and handle potential errors gracefully.
