It also implements the Python iterator interface so that we can iterate over the collection of Row objects directly.\n",

    "The Row objects themselves are intended to act like Python named tuples. Below we illustrate a variety of ways to access rows.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Attribute Name - As these are Python named tuples, the tuples have dynamic attribute names matching the names of each column. These names are normally the names that the SQL statement assigns to the columns in each row. While they are usually fairly predictable and can also be controlled by labels, in less defined cases they may be subject to database-specific behaviors:\n",

    "4. Mapping Access - To receive rows as Python mapping objects, which is essentially a read-only version of Python’s interface to the common dict object, the Result may be transformed into a MappingResult object using the Result.mappings() modifier; this is a result object that yields dictionary-like RowMapping objects rather than Row objects:\n",
